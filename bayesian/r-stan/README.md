# Bayesian Analysis Using R Stan

## Overview
This project presents a Bayesian statistical analysis conducted using **R Stan**.  
Stan is used for probabilistic programming and efficient Bayesian inference through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).

The accompanying PDF provides a complete explanation of the statistical model, estimation process, and interpretation of results.
