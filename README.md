# **DC Property Statistical Analysis Portfolio**

## **Overview**
This portfolio showcases **five applied statistical, Bayesian, and machine learning projects** analyzing residential property data in Washington, DC. These projects demonstrate your ability to design end‑to‑end analytical workflows, develop interpretable statistical models, implement Bayesian inference, and build predictive machine learning systems.

The work reflects professional competencies in:
- Statistical modeling and inference  
- Bayesian hierarchical modeling (JAGS & Stan)  
- Predictive modeling and model comparison  
- Reproducible R workflows  
- Interactive data applications (R Shiny)
